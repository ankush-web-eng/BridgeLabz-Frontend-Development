            <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that clean code delights both writer and reader.
                <mark>Consistency</mark> makes maintenance easier and collaboration smoother.</p>
            <p>Design decisions reflect priorities. When clarity is valued, interfaces become forgiving and robust.
                <mark>Readable</mark> function names help future developers navigate logic.</p>
            <blockquote>Good code is like writing that respects its audience; it anticipates questions and answers them
                clearly.</blockquote>
            <p>Tools evolve, but the principles remain. Prioritizing semantics and structure yields resilient systems
                that adapt without breaking.</p>
            <p>Testing complements design; tests document expected behavior and guard against regressions. Balance
                between speed and correctness is essential.</p>
            <p>Documentation provides context. A single well-crafted paragraph can save hours of debugging for someone
                months later.</p>
